# Crows Nest 🏴‍☠️

An SQL-like graphical user interface for your Solana Program accounts built initially for Nautilus.
Crow's Nest supports any Anchor/Shank Programs that have generated [Solita](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/solita) Types.

## Roadmap

```
✅ - GUI
✅ - Read Accounts
𐄂 - Write/Create for Accounts ( Nautilus only )
𐄂 - Storage Buckets ( Nautilus only )
𐄂 - Foreign Key Relationships
```

## Get started with Crow's Nest 🚀
`git clone https://github.com/nautilus-project/crows-nest.git`
Now, generate Solita Types for your program and add them into `src/`
Then run `yarn dev`

## How does the GUI look like ? ✨
